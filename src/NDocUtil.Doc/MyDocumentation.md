=======================

This code snippet is refreshed on every unit test run:

<!--# MY_CODE_SNIPPET -->
```C#
var now = DateTime.Now; // this line will be included
```

As well as the following console snippet:

<!--# MY_CONSOLE_SNIPPET -->
```
This line will be exported into the console snippet
```

Bingo!
