NDocUtil
========

NDocUtil enables to automatically maintain C# and console snippets in your documentation and presentations. 

You declare snippets in unit tests. After that, you can automatically:

- Update the snippets contained in your markdown documentation 
- Export the snippets as row file, colored html fragment or colored image, either pixel-image like PNG, BMP... or lossless EMF/WMF image.

Have you ever made a powerpoint presentation containing code snippets? The maintenance of code snippets is a nightmare! :-( With *NDocUtil*, it becomes a dream :-)) The code snippets are refreshed automatically on each compilation!
  
*NDocUtil* was primarly developed to write the documentation of the [NCase] project. 

let's see how it works...
